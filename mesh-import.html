                </p>
                <p ><h3>
                    Ever wondered why does your 3d scene is lacking consistency? <br>
                    Why does some static meshes you import from a DCC look sharp and crisp, while others are just dull and lacking in detail? <br>
                    If you answered yes to both of these - then 99.9999% the culprit is Texel Density!
                </h3></p>
                <p><h4>
                    First, let's consider the fact, that while your screen uses pixels to display rgba data, a 3d object wrapped with an image must have some way of measuring the spread of pixels within a polygon. <br>
                    It is this equivalent of a pixel we are thinking about here, which when measured and compared against, can equate to the pixels on our screen. <br>
                    To be more precise, we need a way to keep track of how much pixels a texture renders by the engine - ON EVERY POLYGON - in a precise manner, that does not leaves any room for ambiguity. <br>
                    By utilizing Texel Density application to our 3d meshes in our DCC, we earn the capability of being in control over how much detail each mesh is portrayed through. <br>
                    With this new found degree of control, the precision in which we wrap the UV layout of our meshes will guarantee their coherence when all are rendered together in a 3d scene. <br>
                </h4></p>
                <p><h3>
                    But how does Texel Density work?
                </h3></p>
                <p><h4>
                    Texels are measured in real-world units: this means, that even though a pixel is equal to a texel, we think of how much pixels we want to fit within 1 Meter in the scene. <br>
                    For example, a Pixel Density of 10.24 would fit 1024 pixels within 1 meter in our scene. <br>
                    A Pixel Density of 20.48 would fit 2048 pixels within 1 meter in our scene. <br>
                    A Pixel Density of 40.96 would fit 4096 pixels within 1 meter in our scene. <br>
                </h4></p>
                <p><h4>
                    Knowing this, we can decide how much detail objects should be given, based on our projects performance budget, as well as the placement of the objects in the 3d scene - in relation to the player's position. <br>
                    It would not make any sense to give the underneath of a car that no one is going to see a 4K texture, nor will it make sense to give a distant mountain whose details could not be perceived from afar an 8K texture! <br>
                    The same logic applies to texel density - if it's an object that is likely to be closer to our player viewpoint, it should be getting a higher Pixel Density standard. <br>
                    Conversely, if it's an object that is likely to be further away from the player's viewpoint, then it should be getting a lower Pixel Density standard.

                    Basically, the UV islands of our 3d mesh can be set with a TD value that determines the amount of detail it will have (according to a pixels-per-meter ratio), which would define a precise level of detail. <br>
                    Now, this is just a one 3d model, which is a decent amount of work in of itself.
                    Before ever being concerned about Texel Density, our mesh should have a proper UV layout wrapped - with no overlaps, unless each island represents a diferent Material Slot. <br><br>
