                The World is the top level object representing a map or a sandbox in which Actors and Components will exist and be rendered.
                A World can be a single Persistent Level with an optional list of streaming levels that are loaded and unloaded via volumes and blueprint functions or it can be a collection of levels organized with a World Composition.
                In a standalone game, generally only a single World exists except during seamless area transitions when both a destination and current world exists. In the editor many Worlds exist: The level being edited, each PIE instance, each editor tool which has an interactive rendered viewport, and many more.
